    <p>The Shattered Humaniod is a creature that is 65 feet, is a "ghost creature", and with no known weaknesses. Shattered in particular like to stalk their prey, watching them arrive at their destination of choice. No, they don't like cameras and would attack anyone who dares approach them with one, breaking all of of their victims bones and hiding them. As these Shattered are afraid of being stared at and photographed, avoid eye contact to not become grabbed or eaten. If a blackout occurs at 2:50 AM, DO NOT investigate until around 2:58 AM. Your free to do so after the time stated.
